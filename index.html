    <br>I, Heinz Ulrich V, am a partner, a father, a son, a friend, and all around fun-loving person. My friends refer to me as "The Heinz Barron". And yes, 
    <br>we always spelled <i>Barron</i> incorrectly. We thought we were clever. Throughout my life I have been two things: an athlete and a muscian. More 
    <br> importantly, I have always been highly dedicated to whatever I have put my mind to.
    <br>
    <br>Over the last 14 years I dedicated myself to the Craft Brewing Industry, working my way up from working as a temporary worker, to eventually
    <br>becoming a manger. With a desire to spend more time with my family I decided to leave the industry and begin a new path in web development.
    <br>Having had no prior experience with coding, I enrolled in the <span class="msu">Michigan State Universiry</span> <a href="https://bootcamp.msu.edu/coding/">Coding Bootcamp</a>.
