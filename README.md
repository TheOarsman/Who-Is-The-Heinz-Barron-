# Who Is The Heinz Barron>

## Overview

Hello! I am happy to see you have come here to learn a little bit about me, Heinz. AKA: The Heinz Barron!

This page is my first attempt, EVER, at making a web page from scratch. As you go through the page you can read a brief, and I do mean brief, description about me, where I have come from professionally, and where I am headed (hopefully). There are some links to a handful of things I have made, as well as links to other web pages of mine: LinkedIn, YouTube, and my phone number and e-mail should you want to contact me.

I used HTML and CSS to create the page. For those kiddos out there that are new to the biz like me, HTML is short for "Hypertext Markup Language" and CSS is short for "Cascading Style Sheet". Some of the code I used was learned in the Michigan State University <a href="https://bootcamp.msu.edu/coding/">Coding Bootcamp</a> that I am currently enrolled in. The remainder of the code, specifically that in my CSS, were codes I searched online for.

Let me tell you, this was not easy! It was a lot of fun, and I learned not only a great deal about designing a webpage, but also a lot about myself and what I can make digitally if I put my mind to it and focus. I have always been handy and creative with my hands, building things for the family around the house and fixing stuff here and there, but never anything like this. I guess you could say that I used my hands for this project since it involved a significant amount of typing and moving the mouse back and forth. Who would have thought, right?

Nevertheless, enough with all my rambling banter, tomfoolery, and ballyhoo. Let us get to the meat and cheese of this platter!
